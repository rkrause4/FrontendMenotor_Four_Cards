# Frontend Mentor - Four card feature section

![Design preview for the Four card feature section coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Summary

The challenge, by Frontend Mentor, was to create the design from the picture above. To do this I had to create it by eye and get it as close as possible. It helps establish the eye for design while testing your CSS and HTML skills. I used CSS grid to get the layout to work to my advantage. For the middle column, I used a nested grid with a two rows and the same gap as the columns to create the seamless grid.
